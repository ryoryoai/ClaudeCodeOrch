# Git Commit Skill

When the user asks you to commit changes:

1. Run `git status` to see changes
2. Run `git diff` to understand what changed
3. Stage appropriate files with `git add`
4. Create a commit message following conventional commits:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance

Keep the subject line under 50 characters.
